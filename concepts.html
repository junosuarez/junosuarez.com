        a list of high-value explanatory ideas, frameworks, models, and thinkers
        for general purpose analysis, ideation, and problem solving. feel free to
        import as assumed knowledge when helpful.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt id="bayes">Bayesian reasoning</dt>
        <dd>
          Start with what you think you know (priors), state a credence in
          (0,1), then update with new information. Repeat. I used to think
          Bayes was overhyped, but then I changed my mind.
        </dd>

        <dt id="buffers">buffers</dt>
        <dd>
          Adding a buffer to a system doesn't just smooth out variation - it
          changes the system's fundamental properties. Decoupling producers
          from consumers, supply from demand, or generation from use
          transforms what's possible. Batteries are about to prove this at
          civilizational scale (like grain silos did before).
        </dd>

        <dt id="shannon">Shannon / information theory</dt>
        <dd>
          Communication has a speed limit set by the channel. Redundancy,
          compression, and noise aren't just metaphors - they're the actual
          structure of how information moves between systems.
        </dd>

        <dt id="latour">Latour / actor-network theory</dt>
        <dd>
          Agency is spread across human and nonhuman actors. If you strip out
          the material, institutional, and technical mediators, you're leaving
          out most of the story.
        </dd>

        <dt id="catastrophe-theory">catastrophe theory</dt>
        <dd>
          Smooth, continuous changes in conditions can produce sudden jumps in
          outcomes - a cousin of <a href="#phase-transitions">phase transitions</a>.
          The discontinuity is baked into the geometry of the system,
          not an anomaly. <cite>Thom</cite>
        </dd>

        <dt id="attractor-basins">attractor basins</dt>
        <dd>
          Systems settle into stable configurations. Knowing which basin you're
          in, and what it takes to escape it, matters more than analyzing the
          current position alone.
        </dd>

        <dt id="rugged-landscapes">rugged fitness landscapes</dt>
        <dd>
          Optimization surfaces are full of local peaks. Hill climbing alone
          gets you stuck; see <a href="#annealing">annealing</a>. The shape of
          the problem determines which search strategies actually work. <cite>Wright</cite>
        </dd>

        <dt id="systems-theory">systems theory</dt>
        <dd>
          Behavior comes from the structure of
          <a href="#stock-and-flow">feedback loops, stocks, flows</a>,
          and delays - not from the intentions of individual parts. Leverage
          points are often counterintuitive.
        </dd>

        <dt id="complex-adaptive-systems">complex adaptive systems</dt>
        <dd>
          Agents following simple local rules generate macro-level patterns
          nobody designed. Emergence, adaptation, and
          <a href="#path-dependence">path dependence</a> are
          features, not bugs.
        </dd>

        <dt id="self-organized-criticality">self-organized criticality</dt>
        <dd>
          Many systems naturally drift toward a
          <a href="#phase-transitions">critical state</a> where small
          nudges can cascade at any scale. The sandpile doesn't need tuning to
          produce avalanches. <cite>Bak</cite>
        </dd>

        <dt id="deep-time">deep time</dt>
        <dd>
          Thinking across geological and evolutionary timescales changes what
          counts as fast, slow, stable, or transient - see also
          <a href="#pace-layers">pace layers</a>. Most of what looks
          permanent is just slow-moving.
        </dd>

        <dt id="satisficing">Herbert Simon / satisficing</dt>
        <dd>
          Optimal solutions are often computationally intractable or just
          unknowable - especially on
          <a href="#rugged-landscapes">rugged landscapes</a>. Bounded
          rationality means choosing "good enough" on purpose, not as a
          failure mode.
        </dd>

        <dt id="goodharts-law">Goodhart's law / proxy failure</dt>
        <dd>
          When a measure becomes a target, it stops being a good measure. But
          proxy cascade offers a corrective: higher-level proxies can constrain
          and correct lower-level proxy failure.
        </dd>

        <dt id="pace-layers">pace layers</dt>
        <dd>
          Different layers of a system move at different speeds, and that's
          load-bearing. Fast layers innovate, slow layers stabilize. Problems
          come from trying to force them into the same tempo. <cite>Brand</cite>
        </dd>

        <dt id="boundary-objects">boundary objects</dt>
        <dd>
          Things that sit between communities, plastic enough to mean something
          different to each group but robust enough to hold the collaboration
          together. Maps, standards, prototypes. <cite>Star & Griesemer</cite>
        </dd>

        <dt id="spin-glass">spin glass models</dt>
        <dd>
          Systems with competing, frustrated constraints that can't all be
          satisfied at once. There's no clean global optimum, just a sprawl of
          near-equivalent messy compromises. <cite>Parisi</cite>
        </dd>

        <dt id="phase-transitions">phase transitions</dt>
        <dd>
          At critical thresholds, more of the same input produces something
          qualitatively different. The interesting behavior lives right at the
          boundary between regimes.
        </dd>

        <dt id="affordances">affordances</dt>
        <dd>
          The environment doesn't just exist passively - it offers possibilities
          for action. What you can do is a relationship between the agent and
          the world, not a property of either alone. <cite>Gibson</cite>
        </dd>

        <dt id="coarse-graining">coarse-graining / multiple realizability</dt>
        <dd>
          The right level of description throws away detail on purpose. Many
          different micro-configurations produce the same macro-behavior, and
          that's what makes higher-level explanations legitimate, not just
          convenient. Related: <a href="#carving-at-the-joints">carving at

        <dd>
          Some category boundaries track real structure in the world and others
          are just conventions. Figuring out which is which is most of the work
          in getting a model right. <cite>Plato, <i>via</i> Quine</cite>
        </dd>

        <dt id="markov-blankets">Markov blankets</dt>
        <dd>
          The statistical boundary between a system and its environment. What a
          thing "is" can be defined by what it screens off. Identity as
          conditional independence. <cite><i>via</i> Friston</cite>
        </dd>

        <dt id="wrights-law">Wright's law</dt>
        <dd>
          Cost drops as a function of cumulative production, not time. Every
          doubling of units produced brings a consistent percentage reduction.
          Learning is baked into doing.
        </dd>

        <dt id="umwelt">umwelt</dt>
        <dd>
          Every organism inhabits its own perceptual world. The tick's universe
          has three relevant signals. Yours has more, but it's still a subset,
          not the whole picture. See also <a href="#unicept">unicept</a>. <cite>von Uexküll</cite>
        </dd>

        <dt id="unicept">unicept</dt>
        <dd>
          A concept isn't a shared universal with a definition - it's a
          particular nest of accumulated information belonging to one person.
          Your "weight" and mine refer to whatever each of us has been
          collecting information about, not to some agreed-upon paradigm.
          A shared "concept" is really a fuzzy overlap of many unicepts.
          <cite>Millikan</cite>
        </dd>

        <dt id="stpa">STPA (systems-theoretic process analysis)</dt>
        <dd>
          An analytical framework that models safety as a control problem
          rather than a component reliability problem. Start from hazards, map
          the control structure, find where constraints go unenforced.
        </dd>

        <dt id="stock-and-flow">stock and flow</dt>
        <dd>
          Stocks accumulate, flows change them. Most confusion about system
          behavior comes from not tracking which is which. Bathtub dynamics are
          surprisingly hard to intuit.
          <cite><i>sensu</i> Meadows, Forrester</cite>
        </dd>

        <dt id="feedback">positive / negative feedback</dt>
        <dd>
          Negative feedback stabilizes, positive feedback amplifies. Most
          interesting system behavior comes from the interplay between the two,
          and knowing which one is dominant right now.
        </dd>

        <dt id="desire-paths">desire paths</dt>
        <dd>
          The trail worn into the grass tells you where people actually walk,
          not where the planner wanted them to. Observed behavior is a more
          honest signal than stated intent or designed flow.

        <dt id="annealing">annealing</dt>
        <dd>
          You need enough disorder early on to explore the space, then
          gradually tighten to settle into a good solution. Too much order too

          Early choices constrain later ones, often irreversibly. The current
          state of a system tells you as much about the sequence of past
          decisions as it does about present fitness. <cite>Arthur</cite>

        <dt id="motivated-reasoning">motivated reasoning / talking one's book</dt>
        <dd>
          People find reasons to believe what benefits them. Vested interests,
          entrenchment, and position-defending aren't separate from analysis -
          they shape which evidence gets taken seriously and which gets
          explained away. A failure mode of <a href="#bayes">updating</a>.

          You have to keep running just to stay in place. In co-evolutionary
          dynamics, standing still means falling behind, because everything
          around you is adapting too.

          Energy flow through a system organizes the system. Order doesn't

        <dt id="underdetermination">underdetermination</dt>
        <dd>
          Evidence never fully determines theory. Any experiment tests a whole
          web of assumptions at once, and multiple incompatible models can fit
          the same data. Theory choice involves more than just the evidence.
